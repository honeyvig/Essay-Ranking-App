# Essay-Ranking-App
Enhance the Essay Reader app, which utilizes AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis to rank essays. The ideal candidate will have experience in building algorithms that can sort essays based on custom criteria and improve accuracy in results. Your contribution will help organizations efficiently assess and rank written submissions. If you're passionate about leveraging technology to innovate in education, we’d love to hear from you! We would like to build this app with bolt.new but are open to your suggestions.
====================
To enhance the Essay Reader app using AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis, we will build a system that ranks essays based on custom criteria, such as quality of writing, sentiment, coherence, and relevance to a given prompt.

Here’s a basic structure to guide you through the development of this system using Bolt.new (a modern serverless framework), integrating it with NLP models for essay analysis and sentiment analysis.
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into the code, ensure the following libraries and tools are installed:

    Bolt.new framework for serverless development
    OpenAI GPT models for NLP
    NLTK or spaCy for sentiment analysis and NLP-based tasks
    Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for custom ranking algorithms

First, install the necessary dependencies:

pip install openai nltk spacy scikit-learn

Also, download a spaCy model for sentiment analysis and text processing:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Step 2: Python Code for Essay Ranking

This Python code will use NLP for processing the essay, sentiment analysis to gauge the tone and emotion of the essay, and a custom ranking algorithm to rank essays based on user-defined criteria.

import openai
import spacy
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Load spaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Sentiment analysis using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment_score = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    return sentiment_score

# Function to process essays and extract key features (e.g., sentiment, quality, structure)
def process_essay(essay):
    # Analyze sentiment
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(essay)
    
    # Perform NLP on the essay text for additional features (e.g., word count, sentence complexity)
    doc = nlp(essay)
    word_count = len([token for token in doc if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct])
    sentence_count = len([sent for sent in doc.sents])
    avg_sentence_length = word_count / sentence_count if sentence_count > 0 else 0
    
    return {
        "sentiment_score": sentiment['compound'],  # Sentiment score for ranking
        "word_count": word_count,
        "sentence_count": sentence_count,
        "avg_sentence_length": avg_sentence_length
    }

# Rank essays based on sentiment, word count, and sentence complexity
def rank_essays(essays):
    essay_features = []
    
    for essay in essays:
        features = process_essay(essay)
        essay_features.append(features)
    
    # Sort essays based on sentiment score (higher is more positive), then by word count, and sentence length
    ranked_essays = sorted(essay_features, key=lambda x: (x["sentiment_score"], x["word_count"], x["avg_sentence_length"]), reverse=True)
    return ranked_essays

# Use GPT-3 for essay quality scoring or generate a summary
def generate_essay_score(essay_text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use GPT-4 if available
        prompt=f"Please provide a score for the following essay based on content quality, coherence, and structure:\n{essay_text}",
        max_tokens=50
    )
    score = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return score

# Example usage:
essays = [
    "Essay 1 content goes here. It talks about AI in education and its impacts on learning.",
    "Essay 2 content goes here. It covers the topic of climate change and environmental responsibility.",
    "Essay 3 content goes here. It discusses the effects of social media on mental health."
]

# Rank essays based on the defined criteria
ranked_essays = rank_essays(essays)
for idx, essay in enumerate(ranked_essays, start=1):
    print(f"Rank {idx}: Sentiment: {essay['sentiment_score']}, Word Count: {essay['word_count']}, Avg Sentence Length: {essay['avg_sentence_length']}")
    
    # Generate quality score using GPT-3
    essay_score = generate_essay_score(essays[idx - 1])
    print(f"GPT-3 Score: {essay_score}")
    print("")

Step 3: Explanation of Key Components

    Sentiment Analysis: Using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, we analyze the sentiment of each essay. The sentiment score is used to rank the essays based on how positive or negative the content is. You can modify this to rank essays based on tone or emotion, depending on your criteria.

    NLP Features: Using spaCy, we analyze the essay's structure, including the word count, sentence count, and average sentence length. These features can help evaluate the quality and complexity of the writing.

    Ranking Essays: The essays are ranked based on a combination of factors: sentiment score, word count, and average sentence length. You can modify the ranking criteria based on your custom requirements (e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar, etc.).

    GPT-3 Scoring: Using OpenAI's GPT-3, we can further assess the essay's quality by generating a score based on factors such as coherence, structure, and relevance. The GPT-3 model helps provide a subjective assessment of the content quality, which can be used to further enhance the essay ranking.

Step 4: Integration with Bolt.new

While this Python code handles the AI ranking algorithm, to integrate it with Bolt.new and deploy it as a serverless app, you can create an API endpoint that interacts with this logic.

Here’s how you can use Bolt.new to expose this functionality via a web endpoint:

    Install Bolt.new:

npm install @bolt/cli

    Create a simple Bolt.new app with the following structure:

const bolt = require('@bolt/cli');
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/rank-essays', (req, res) => {
  const { essays } = req.body;
  
  // Here you would call the Python script or invoke the ranking algorithm
  // We use the Python code above for ranking essays
  
  // Call Python script or integrate directly with an AI service
  const rankedEssays = rankEssays(essays);
  
  res.json({ rankedEssays });
});

bolt.start();

Step 5: Deployment and Scaling

Once you have the serverless API set up using Bolt.new, deploy the app to your preferred platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or another cloud provider). This will allow you to scale the essay ranking system to handle multiple users and large volumes of essays.
Step 6: Future Improvements

    Custom Essay Evaluation Metrics: Further fine-tune the ranking algorithm by adding additional custom features like grammar checking, keyword relevance, or even peer-reviewed feedback for essays.

    Machine Learning for Essay Scoring: Implement machine learning models for scoring essays using pre-labeled data sets (e.g., essays graded by experts). Train a model using scikit-learn or TensorFlow to predict essay scores based on various features.

    User Interface: Build a simple front-end using React or Vue.js to allow users to upload essays and view rankings in real time.

This approach will help you leverage AI, NLP, and sentiment analysis to efficiently rank essays, providing a scalable and intelligent solution for educational institutions and organizations.
